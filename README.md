# Hi there

([Espa√±ol](https://github.com/K-Embee/K-Embee/blob/master/README_es.md))

I'm Kieran, a software developer who has recently graduated from the University of Granada, with a degree in Computer Science/Software Engineering. Right now this GitHub is mostly for my student projects, but I'll be adding more personal projects in the future.

## Open-Source Personal Projects
* **Recoil**: A top-down adventure/shooter game made in 48 hours for the Miz Jam 1. Made entirely in JavaScript.
    * Repository Link: https://github.com/K-Embee/Recoil_Game
